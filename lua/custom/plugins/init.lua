--  I promise not to create any merge conflicts in this directory :)

  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
  --
  --  This is equivalent to:
  --    require('Comment').setup({})

  -- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
  -- NOTE: nixCats: nix downloads it with a different file name.
  -- tell lazy about that.

  -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
  --
  -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
  -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
  --
  -- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

  -- Highlight todo, notes, etc in comments

  -- The following two comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the

  -- place them in the correct locations.

  --  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
  --  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
  --
  -- NOTE: nixCats: instead of uncommenting them, you can enable them
  -- from the categories set in your packageDefinitions in your flake or other template!
  -- This is because within them, we used nixCats to check if it should be loaded!
